'''
This optimized code helps Rajeev minimize financial loss when buying and selling a house by analyzing projected prices over the years. It uses sorting and indexing to efficiently find the smallest loss where buying happens before selling. The approach improves performance from O(nÂ²) to O(n log n), making it scalable.
